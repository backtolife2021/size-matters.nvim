| **Keymaps**           |                            |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Increase font size    | `Ctrl++` / `Ctrl+ScrollUp`   |

| Reset font to default | `Atl+Ctrl+=`                  |

## Installation

Via a plugin manager like e.g., Packer

```lua
use "tenxsoydev/size-matters.nvim"
```

### Requirements

nvim >= v0.7. As the vim.api that was introduced with v0.7 is used.<br>
Being the latest stable release, we'll recommend upgrading your application and config when possible.

## Outlook

- [ ] Pop-up indicator for current font-size when switching
- [ ] Export options. E.g., for custom mappings / Pop-up visibility
- [ ] Branch with support for versions \< 0.7 (if there is a commuinty need for it)
